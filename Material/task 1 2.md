Dear Saptarshi,

Here I am sharing the links to two playlists with you. The first is for understanding the basics of computer architecture, and the second link is for advanced-level concepts.

For clearing Computer Architecture Basics: (Task I)
Watch these lecture videos starting from Lecture 1 to Lecture 6. You can also watch the remaining lectures if you want to know more. 
[PlayList - 1](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMPEI4J8nz9uF8W4fCezV6pqYJcJdTNK)
You can take one week to clear your basics.

For advanced-level concepts: (Task II)
Please watch lectures 1,3,4,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, and 15 from this playlist. You can take one week to complete watching these lectures. 
[PlayList - 2](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMPEI4J8nz95MwLZgM3RbBP2deDYzIU7)


After completing these tasks, I will conduct a small test for you to ensure that you are ready for the subsequent work. You have to complete watching the above videos by June 26th, 2022.
